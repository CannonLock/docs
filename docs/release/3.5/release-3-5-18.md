    OSG 3.5 and 3.4 offer a rolling release repository where packages are added as soon as they pass acceptance testing.
    To install packages from this repository, enable `[osg-rolling]` in `/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-rolling.repo`:

        [osg-rolling]
        ...
        enabled=1

    Or for one-time installations, append the following to your `yum` command:

        --enablerepo=osg-rolling

Summary of Changes
------------------

This release contains:

-   [Frontier Squid 4.11-3.1](http://frontier.cern.ch/dist/frontier-squid-releasenotes.txt): Fixed critical bug that causes server errors to be cached indefinitely which may require caches to be cleared. The bug was introduced in version 4.10-3.1
-   VOMS 2.0.14-1.6: Allow VOMS libraries to accept certificates with VOMS attributes that only have a top-level component, such as those provided by the WLCG VO
-   XCache 1.4
    -   added xcache-consistency-check
    -   advertise to the OSG Central Collector via SSL
    -   reduced default XRootD logging verbosity
-   stashcache-client 5.6.1: reads the list of caches from the globally available WLCG-WPAD service; this allows updates to the cache list without a new release of stashcache-client
