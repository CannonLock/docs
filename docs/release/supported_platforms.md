OSG Software Supported Operating Systems
==========================================

The OSG Software 3.3 and 3.4 release series are supported on Red Hat Enterprise 6 and 7 for 64-bit (RHEL 6 and RHEL 7) and 32-bit (RHEL 6 only) Intel architectures.

OSG also supports select rebuilds of RHEL.  Specifically:

-   CentOS 6
-   CentOS 7
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
-   Scientific Linux 6
-   Scientific Linux 7

OSG builds and tests its RPMs on the latest releases of the relevant platforms (e.g., in 2018, the RHEL 7 builds were based on RHEL 7.5).
Older releases of the OS may not receive thorough testing and have subtle bugs; we may ask sites to update to the latest OS packages
as part of the support process.
