!!! danger "Before considering an upgrade to OSG 3.6&hellip;"
    Due to potentially disruptive changes in protocols, contact your VO(s) to verify that they support token-based
    authentication and/or HTTP-based data transfer before considering an upgrade to OSG 3.6.
    If your VO(s) don't support these new protocols or you don't know which protocols your VO(s) support,
    install or remain on the [OSG 3.5 release series](notes.md).

OSG 3.6 News
============

**Supported OS Versions:** EL7, EL8

The OSG 3.6 release series is a major overhaul of the OSG software stack compared to previous release series with
changes to core protocols used for authentication and data transfer:
bearer tokens, such as [SciTokens](https://scitokens.org/) or WLCG tokens, are used for authentication instead of
GSI proxies and HTTP is used for data transfer instead of GridFTP.

To support these new protocols, OSG 3.6 includes HTCondor 8.9, HTCondor-CE 5, and will shortly include HTCondor 9.0,
GlideinWMS 3.9, and XRootD 5.1.
We also dropped support for the GridFTP, GSI authentication, and Hadoop.

Known Issues
------------

The following issues are known to currently affect packages distributed in OSG 3.6:

### HTCondor-CE ###

-   `default_CERequirements` in the the new Job Router ClassAd transform syntax is ignored.
    To fix this, apply the change in [this patch](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-ce/pull/530/files) to
    `/usr/share/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-router-defaults.conf`.
    The next release of HTCondor-CE will contain this fix and will not require any additional action post-update.
-   If you are using HTCondor from the 3.6 Upcoming repository,
    C-style comments, e.g. `/* comment */`, in `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES` will prevent the JobRouter from routing jobs
    ([HTCONDOR-864](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-864)).
    For the time being, remove any comments if you are still using the
    [deprecated syntax](https://htcondor.com/htcondor-ce/v5/configuration/job-router-overview#deprecated-syntax).

### XRootD Multiuser ###

-   The OSG 3.6 configuration of XRootD uses the `XrdVoms` plugin, which pass along the entire VOMS FQAN as the
    groupname to the authorization layer (see the section on
    [authorization database file formatting](../data/xrootd/xrootd-authorization.md#formatting)).
    Some characters in VOMS FQANs are not legal in Unix usernames, therefore VOMS attributes mappings are incompatible
    with `xrootd-multiuser`.
    See [XRootD GitHub issue #1538](https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/issues/1538) for more details.

    for updating from version 0.2.5

### **February 26, 2021:** 3.6 Released

!!! question "Where are GlideinWMS and XRootD?"
    XRootD and GlideinWMS are both absent in the initial OSG 3.6 release:
    we expect major version updates that may require manual intervention for both of these packages so we are holding
    their initial releases in this series until they are ready.

!!! warning "OSG 3.5 end-of-life"
    As a result of this initial OSG 3.6 release, the end-of-life dates have been set for OSG 3.5 per our
    [policy](https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/release-series/):
    regular support will end in **August 2021** and critical bug/security support will end in **May 2022**.


This initial release of the OSG 3.6 release series is based on the packages available in OSG 3.5.31.
One of the major changes in this release series is the shift to token-based authentication from GSI proxy-based
authentication.
Here is a list of the differences in this initial release:

-   GridFTP, GSI, and Hadoop are no longer available
-   Added packages to support token-based authentication
-   [HTCondor 8.9.11](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/version-history/development-release-series-89.html#version-8-9-11):
    initial token support (8.9.12, which will contain default configuration using tokens, was delayed)
-   [HTCondor-CE 5.0.0](https://htcondor.github.io/htcondor-ce/v5/releases/):
    support for Python 3
-   [Gratia Probe 2.0.0](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gratia-probe/releases/tag/v2.0.0-2):
    replace all batch system probes with the non-root HTCondor-CE probe
-   [OSG-Configure 4.0.0](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-configure/releases/tag/v4.0.0):
    - Deprecated RSV
    - Dropped unused configuration modules and attributes
    - Reorganized some configuration (see [update instructions](updating-to-osg-36.md#osg-configure) for more details)

In addition, we have updated our
[Software Release Policy](https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/software-release/) to follow a rolling
release model.

Finally, our [Docker image releases](https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/container-release/) will more
closely track our OSG 3.6 repositories.
