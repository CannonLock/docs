OSG Site Documentation
======================

Welcome to the home of the Open Science Grid (OSG) Site Administrator documentation!  This documentation aims to
provide OSG site admins with the necessary information to install, configure, and operate site services.

If you are not a site adminstrator:

- If you are a **researcher** interested in using OSG resources, you may want to view our
  [user documentation](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home).
- If you'd like to learn more about the OSG and our mission, visit the OSG consortium's
  [homepage](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/).

This document outlines the overall installation process for an OSG site and provides many links into detailed
installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and similar pages. If you do not see software-related technical
documentation listed here, try the search bar at the top or contacting us at
[help@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org).
