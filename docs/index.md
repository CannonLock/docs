Open Science Grid Site Documentation
====================================

!!! note
    This is currently a work in progress as we migrate our TWiki documentation to GitHub, so please let us know of any issues that you encounter by [opening a ticket](https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org) or e-mailing [goc@opensciencegrid.org](goc@opensciencegrid.org) with a description of your issue.

Welcome to the home page of the Open Science Grid (OSG) Site documentation! The documentation contained here is designed for system adminstrators that provide resources to the OSG. If you're a new resource provider, the [Installation Overview](install-overview) is a good place to get started. Otherwise, you can find a list of our documents via the navigation and search bars to the left.

If you are not a site adminstrator...

- If you are a researcher interested in using OSG resources, you can find user documentation [here](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home). 
- If you'd like to learn more about the OSG and our mission, visit our website [here](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/).
